# Atmosphere
This is an Android weather application that tells you the current weather of a specified location. 
This app uses the weather API from [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/api) as well as the [Google Place Picker API](https://developers.google.com/places/android-api/placepicker).


## Prerequisites
- You will need to have the latest version of **Android Studio (3.0)** installed and working on your computer
- Although there are already API keys in this app that should function, you might need to create your own for yours to work. Check the 'Obtain API Key' section

## How to Run
Simply clone this repository and open up the project in Android Studio!

## Obtain API Key
In the case that the current API keys in this app don't work, you'll need to generate your own for both the Open Weather API as well as the Google Location API.
You can follow the links below to generate your own APIs:
- [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/appid#get)
- [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/get-api-key)
